# Account-Based Model

## Overview

Ethereum's account-based model represents a fundamental shift from Bitcoin's UTXO system, introducing a more flexible and programmable approach to blockchain state management.

## Types of Accounts

### Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs)
- Controlled by private keys
- Can initiate transactions
- Hold ETH balance
- No associated code
- Nonce tracks transaction count

### Contract Accounts
- Controlled by code
- Can't initiate transactions
- Hold ETH balance
- Contains contract code
- Has associated storage

## State Management

### Global State
- Mapping of addresses to account states
- Updated with each block
- Includes all account balances and contract storage
- Maintained by all full nodes

### Account State
- Nonce (transaction count/contract creation count)
- Balance (in Wei)
- Storage root (for contract accounts)
- Code hash (for contract accounts)

## Key Features

### Nonce System
- Prevents transaction replay attacks
- Ensures transaction ordering
- Increments with each transaction
- Different meaning for EOAs vs contracts

### Storage Model
- Key-value store for contracts
- 256-bit to 256-bit mapping
- Persistent between contract calls
- Cost of storage reflected in gas fees

## Advantages Over UTXO

### Simplicity
- Direct balance tracking
- Easier to understand
- More intuitive for developers
- Natural fit for smart contracts

### Programmability
- Native support for complex logic
- Direct state access
- Efficient contract interactions
- Stateful programming model

### Efficiency
- Reduced transaction size
- Simpler balance updates
- Better for token transfers
- Easier to track state

## Practical Applications

### Smart Contract Integration
- Direct state access
- Atomic operations
- Complex state transitions
- Multi-step transactions

### Token Standards
- Natural fit for ERC-20
- Simple balance tracking
- Efficient transfers
- Built-in state management

## Trade-offs

### Privacy
- More transparent balances
- Less transaction privacy
- Easier to track flows
- Clear state transitions

### Scalability
- State growth challenges
- Storage costs
- Node requirements
- Sync considerations

The account-based model forms the foundation of Ethereum's ability to support complex smart contracts and decentralized applications, making it a crucial innovation in blockchain technology.
