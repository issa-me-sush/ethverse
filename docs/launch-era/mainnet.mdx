# Ethereum Mainnet Launch

## Genesis Block: July 30, 2015

The launch of Ethereum mainnet marked a revolutionary moment in blockchain history, introducing the world's first programmable blockchain platform. This milestone represented the culmination of years of development and innovation, bringing to life Vitalik Buterin's vision of a platform for decentralized applications.

## Key Innovations

### Programmable Blockchain
- First blockchain with Turing-complete smart contracts
- Introduction of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
- Support for complex decentralized applications (dApps)

### Native Currency
- Ether (ETH) as the network's native currency
- Initial supply of 72 million ETH
- Block rewards for miners
- Gas fee mechanism for transaction processing

### Technical Architecture
- 15-second block time
- Ethash proof-of-work algorithm
- State-based transaction model
- Account abstraction capabilities

## Core Components

The Ethereum mainnet launch introduced several revolutionary components:

1. **Account-Based Model**
   - State-based architecture replacing Bitcoin's UTXO model
   - Support for both user and contract accounts
   - Nonce-based transaction ordering

2. **EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)**
   - Decentralized computer for executing smart contracts
   - Deterministic execution environment
   - Bytecode-based instruction set

3. **Smart Contracts**
   - Self-executing programs on blockchain
   - Solidity programming language
   - Automated trust and coordination

4. **Gas Mechanics**
   - Economic model for resource allocation
   - Prevention of spam and infinite loops
   - Fee market for transaction priority

## Historical Impact
