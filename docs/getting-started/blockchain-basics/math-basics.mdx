# Math & Cryptography Basics

Understanding the mathematical foundations of blockchain technology is crucial for anyone looking to work with or develop blockchain applications. This section covers the essential mathematical and cryptographic concepts that power blockchain technology.

## Core Topics

### 1. [Modular Arithmetic](/docs/getting-started/blockchain-basics/math-basics/modular)
Learn about the mathematical system that underlies many cryptographic operations in blockchain:
- Basic concepts and operations
- Applications in blockchain
- Practical examples and implementations

### 2. [Hash Functions](/docs/getting-started/blockchain-basics/math-basics/hash-functions)
Understand the cryptographic functions that are fundamental to blockchain security:
- Properties of hash functions
- Common hash algorithms
- Use cases in blockchain

### 3. [Public Key Cryptography](/docs/getting-started/blockchain-basics/math-basics/public-key)
Explore the asymmetric cryptography that enables secure transactions:
- Public and private keys
- Key generation
- Encryption and decryption

### 4. [Digital Signatures](/docs/getting-started/blockchain-basics/math-basics/signatures)
Learn how digital signatures provide authentication and non-repudiation:
- Signature creation and verification
- ECDSA in blockchain
- Security considerations

## Why These Topics Matter

These mathematical concepts are not just theoretical - they are the building blocks that make blockchain technology possible:

- **Security**: Understanding these concepts helps you grasp how blockchain maintains security
- **Development**: Knowledge of these topics is essential for smart contract development
- **Innovation**: These fundamentals enable you to understand and create new blockchain applications

## Getting Started

We recommend starting with [Modular Arithmetic](/docs/getting-started/blockchain-basics/math-basics/modular) as it provides the foundation for understanding the other topics in this section.
