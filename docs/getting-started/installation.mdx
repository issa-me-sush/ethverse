# Installation Guide

This guide will help you set up EthVerse's documentation platform locally on your machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A package manager ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/))

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the EthVerse documentation repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethverse/docs.git
cd docs
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Using npm

```

## Step 3: Start the Development Server
