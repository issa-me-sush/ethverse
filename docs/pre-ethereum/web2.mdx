# Web2 & Centralized Apps

## The Centralized Web Era

The year 2000 marked the height of Web2.0, where centralized applications and services dominated the internet landscape. This era was characterized by:

- Client-server architecture
- Centralized data storage
- Single points of failure
- Platform-controlled user data
- Traditional business models

## Key Characteristics

### Centralized Control
- Companies owned and controlled user data
- Single entities managed entire platforms
- Centralized decision making

### Traditional Infrastructure
- Centralized servers
- Proprietary databases
- Closed-source software
- Limited interoperability

### Business Model
- Advertisement-driven revenue
- User data monetization
- Platform lock-in
- Middleman economics

## Problems with Centralization

### Security Risks
- Single points of failure
- Attractive targets for hackers
- Data breaches

### User Privacy
- Limited data control
- Privacy concerns
- Data harvesting

### Platform Risk
- Service discontinuation
- Account suspension
- Content censorship

## The Need for Change

The limitations of Web2 set the stage for a new paradigm:
- Growing privacy concerns
- Need for user data ownership
- Desire for trustless systems
- Push for decentralization

This environment would eventually lead to the creation of Bitcoin and later, Ethereum, as solutions to these fundamental issues with centralized systems.
